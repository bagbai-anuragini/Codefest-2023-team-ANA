Project details:
Our project is called iHear. iHear is a google API based speech to text transcriber and SUMY / LUHN based summarizer. AFter transcribing an recorded audio, the transcription is stored in a variable. That is then filtered for punctuation, uncapitalized and tokened into words. sumy is used to create parser and luhn for summarizer. The summary is put in a .pdf file, that is the final output. 

This project has a wide range of usablities like in meetings, class interactions, etc. The google API can also be replaced by whisper for a faster transcribe and other NLP functions can be used to imporve this project like adding a search option for keywords or in a telemedicine situation, it can create a prescription to be virtually approved by a medical Professional. 

Thank You
